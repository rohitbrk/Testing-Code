# Testing-Code

Software products can be tested at three main levels

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End to End Testing

Unit Testing: Unit tests are written to test isolated function's behaviour. This checks the function's
outputs for different inputs. In JavaScript, Jest library can be used for this. 

Integration Testing: This kind of testing is done to test the outcome when multiple functions work
together to perform a task. In JavaScript, Jest library can be used for this.

End to End Testing: This is done to make sure the application is performing as it
is expected from the user's point of view. In JavaScript, Puppeteer library can be used for this.
